#General Project Setup and Working Principle 

Here’s a breakdown of the project’s components and key aspects, addressing potential points of confusion:
Purpose
This project simulates an IoT device (using an Arduino) that generates data and occasional threats (e.g., message floods). It uses AWS Lambda for threat detection, Grafana for visualization, and a Python script for incident response, all tied to AWS IoT Core. It demonstrates threat detection and response capabilities.
Files
arduino_code/threat_simulator.ino: Arduino firmware to simulate an IoT device sending normal and threatening data via serial.
lambda_function.py: AWS Lambda function to detect anomalies (e.g., message floods) and log them to CloudWatch.
response_script.py: Python script to listen for threat alerts and respond (e.g., send a “PAUSE” command).
README.md: Documentation with setup instructions and a demo placeholder.
Hardware
Arduino (e.g., Uno or Nano): Simulates an IoT device. An ESP8266/ESP32 could be used for direct MQTT if preferred (requires code adaptation).
USB Cable: Connects the Arduino to a computer for serial communication.
Software
Arduino IDE: Uploads the firmware to the Arduino.
AWS Services: IoT Core (MQTT), Lambda (threat detection), CloudWatch (logging).
Grafana: Visualizes threat data from CloudWatch (local or cloud-hosted).
Python 3: Runs response_script.py with libraries paho-mqtt and boto3.
Key Features
Threat Simulation: Arduino generates normal data with occasional floods (10% chance).
Threat Detection: Lambda identifies floods (e.g., 10+ messages in 5 seconds).
Response: Python script sends a “PAUSE” command when threats are detected.
Visualization: Grafana displays threat logs from CloudWatch.
Placeholders
Replace your-iot-endpoint.iot.region.amazonaws.com, path/to/your-certificate.pem.crt, path/to/your-private.pem.key, and path/to/AmazonRootCA1.pem in response_script.py with actual AWS IoT Core credentials.
Testing Locally
To test this project and generate a demo (e.g., a screenshot for demo.png), you’ll set up the Arduino, configure AWS, run the Python script, and visualize data in Grafana. Here’s a detailed step-by-step process:
Prerequisites
Hardware: Arduino Uno/Nano, USB cable.
Software: Arduino IDE, Python 3, AWS account, Grafana (local install or cloud instance), MQTT Explorer (optional).
Tools: Computer with USB port.
Step 1: Set Up the Arduino
Install Arduino IDE:
Download from arduino.cc and install.
Upload the Firmware:
Open Arduino IDE, create a new sketch, and paste the threat_simulator.ino content:
cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  String data = "Temp: " + String(random(20, 30)) + "C";
  Serial.println(data);
  delay(1000);  // Normal interval

  if (random(0, 100) < 10) {  // 10% chance
    for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
      Serial.println("Threat: Flood " + String(i));
      delay(10);  // Rapid fire
    }
  }
}
Connect the Arduino via USB.
Select Tools > Board > Arduino Uno (or your model) and the correct port under Tools > Port.
Click the upload button (right arrow). Wait for “Done uploading.”
Test Serial Output:
Open Tools > Serial Monitor (set baud rate to 9600).
Expect normal data every second (e.g., Temp: 25C) and occasional floods (e.g., Threat: Flood 0 to Threat: Flood 49).
Step 2: Bridge Serial to MQTT (Local Setup)
Since the Arduino Uno lacks WiFi, you’ll need a bridge to send serial data to AWS IoT Core. Here’s a simple Python script (serial_to_mqtt.py) to do this:
python
import serial
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import json

SERIAL_PORT = '/dev/ttyUSB0'  # Adjust: e.g., 'COM3' on Windows
BAUD_RATE = 9600
AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT = "your-iot-endpoint.iot.region.amazonaws.com"
CERT_PATH = "path/to/your-certificate.pem.crt"
KEY_PATH = "path/to/your-private.pem.key"
CA_PATH = "path/to/AmazonRootCA1.pem"
TOPIC = "iot/threat/data"

ser = serial.Serial(SERIAL_PORT, BAUD_RATE)

client = mqtt.Client("SerialBridge")
client.tls_set(CA_PATH, CERT_PATH, KEY_PATH)
client.connect(AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT, 8883, 60)
client.loop_start()

while True:
    if ser.in_waiting > 0:
        data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
        payload = {"data": data, "timestamp": str(int(time.time() * 1000))}
        client.publish(TOPIC, json.dumps(payload), qos=1)
        print(f"Published: {payload}")

Install Dependencies: pip3 install paho-mqtt pyserial.
Run: Update credentials and port, then python3 serial_to_mqtt.py.
Step 3: Configure AWS IoT Core and Lambda
Set Up AWS IoT Core:
Create a Thing, download certificates, and attach a policy allowing MQTT actions.
Create an IoT Rule: SELECT * FROM 'iot/threat/data' → Action: Invoke Lambda.
Deploy Lambda:
In AWS Lambda, create a new function (Python 3.x).
Paste lambda_function.py content.
Deploy and link it to the IoT Rule.
Create a CloudWatch log group (IoTThreatMonitor).

#Test MQTT:
Use MQTT Explorer or AWS IoT Core’s “Test” tab.
Subscribe to iot/threat/data and iot/threat/alerts.
Trigger a flood in Serial Monitor; expect an alert on iot/threat/alerts.
Step 4: Run the Response Script
Update response_script.py:
Replace AWS placeholders with your credentials.
Run: python3 response_script.py.
When a flood occurs, it prints the threat and publishes {"command": "PAUSE"} to iot/threat/commands.
Step 5: Set Up Grafana
Install Grafana:
Local: sudo apt install grafana (Linux) or download from grafana.com.
Start: sudo systemctl start grafana-server.
Access: http://localhost:3000 (default login: admin/admin).
Add CloudWatch Data Source:
In Grafana, go to Configuration > Data Sources > Add > CloudWatch.
Configure with your AWS region and credentials.
Select IoTThreatMonitor log group.
Create Dashboard:
Add a panel, query logs for “Threat detected,” and visualize (e.g., table or graph).
Step 6: Generate the Demo
Screenshot: Capture Grafana dashboard showing a threat alert or CloudWatch logs.
Save: Export as demo.png.
Upload to GitHub: Use “Add file” > “Upload files” in the repository.
General Working Principle
Here’s how the project operates:
Data Generation:
The Arduino simulates an IoT device, sending normal data (Temp: 25C) every second via serial.
Randomly (10% chance), it simulates a threat by sending 50 rapid messages (Threat: Flood 0-49).
Data Bridging:
A local script (serial_to_mqtt.py) reads serial data and publishes it to AWS IoT Core (iot/threat/data).

#Threat Detection:
AWS IoT Core triggers the Lambda function for each message.
Lambda tracks message frequency; if 10+ messages arrive in 5 seconds, it logs a threat to CloudWatch and returns a “Threat” status.
Visualization:
CloudWatch stores threat logs (IoTThreatMonitor/ThreatLogs).
Grafana queries CloudWatch and displays threats in a dashboard.
Response:
response_script.py subscribes to iot/threat/alerts.
On detecting a threat, it publishes a “PAUSE” command to iot/threat/commands, simulating a response action.
Flow:
Arduino → Serial → MQTT Bridge → AWS IoT Core → Lambda → CloudWatch → Grafana + Response Script.

#Troubleshooting Tips
No Serial Data: Check baud rate (9600), USB connection, or Arduino IDE port.
MQTT Issues: Verify AWS credentials, endpoint, and policy.
Lambda Fails: Ensure the IoT Rule is correctly linked and logs are created.
Grafana Empty: Confirm CloudWatch data source setup and query syntax.
